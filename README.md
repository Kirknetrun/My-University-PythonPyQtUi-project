# My-University-PythonPyQtUi-project
Python UI project using PyQt5

It is a conceptual project in Python with PyQt5 framework.
The concept was to create a UI that would handle applications that retrieve air quality data and show things like air quality, analyze the air quality and show a map with air measurement stations.

The design of the application was carried out in the Python programming language along with xml positioning languages in the Python QT designer dedicated editor with an add-on in for programming the designed window in QT designer PyQt5.

The most important thing i learned doing this project was to use the object in the designer "Stacked Widget" because on a single sheet you can move/change the pages of the widget. It is more convenient than programming the transition to another remote sheet.
